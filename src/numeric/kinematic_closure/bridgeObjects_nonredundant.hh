/// @brief Non-redundant bridgeObject function.
/// @detail The origional bridgeObject function need some redundant inputs which are just
/// place holders and never used in actual calculation. Here I wrote a wrapper of the original
/// function such that no redundant information are needed. However, this wrapper means even
/// more moving around redundant data. TODO: rewrite the function such that redundant data don't
/// appear at all.
