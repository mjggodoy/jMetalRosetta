/// @brief The ResourceManager is a singleton class responsible for holding, distributing,
/// and eventually deallocating resources which may be shared between multiple jobs.  A
/// protocol may communicate directly with the ResourceManager, requesting resources, but
/// remaining unaware of where those resources came from, or whether the same resource is
/// being used in multiple contexts.
///
/// A protocol should request a resource using a "resource description" (a string), which
/// is a generic way of referring to a piece of data.  For example, a protocol might request
/// the native Pose, by asking for a resource with the description "native".  The
/// ResourceManager's job is to return the resource matching that description; when
/// the "native" is requested, it is requested in some context (e.g. in a protocol running
/// under JD2) and the ResourceManager serves as a backbone in which to deliever
/// context-specific data to the protocol, while keeping the protocol ignorant and
/// independent of the surrounding context.  That way protocols can run in JD2 just as
/// effectively as the could run in some other job-management environment, without
/// having to assume responsibility for instantiating resources themselves.
///
/// NOTE: Because the logic for deciding which of the derived ResourceManager classes
/// should be instantiated depends on the options system, the ResourceManager should
/// not be requested until after core::init::init() has been called (i.e. it should not
/// be requested at load time.)
