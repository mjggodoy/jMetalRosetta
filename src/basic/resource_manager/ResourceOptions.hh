/// @brief The %ResourceOptions class is responsible for describing all
/// the data requried for instanting a particular resource, except for the
/// data stream (i.e. the file) that contains the data for the resource.
/// For example, when reading in a PDB file, there are 30 different options
/// for how that PDB file should be turned into a Pose.  That data is now
/// held in an ImportPoseOptions object.  The purpose of the %ResourceOptions
/// class is to allow different jobs to load resources in different ways, or
/// for one job to load two different resources of the same type in different
/// ways. For example, a protocol may need both a centroid pose and a
/// fullatom pose to be loaded in from disk; however, if the logic for
/// loading a pose in from disk is controlled by the options system alone,
/// this becomes impossible.
