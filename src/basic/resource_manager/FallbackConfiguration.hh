/// @brief The %FallbackConfiguration class describes how a resource should
/// be created if the ResourceManager is not being used, i.e., if resources
/// have been specified through flags on the command line instead of through
/// a resource-definition file.
///
/// A protocol will still query the ResourceManager
/// for its desired resource in such a case (by its "resource_description")
/// and if no resource has been provided for that description, then the
/// ResourceManager will ask the FallbackConfigurationFactory for the
/// %FallbackConfiguration that has been registered for that resource
/// description (this registration logic is handled by the
/// FallbackConfigurationCreator) and ask it to provide the information
/// necessary to create the appropriate resource from the command line.
///
/// For example, a user can define the loop they are interested in modeling to
/// the loop-modeling protocol via the LoopsFileData resource.  The loop modeling
/// protocol once was but is no longer responsible for opening a text file
/// and creating a LoopsFileData object from that text file; instead it asks the
/// ResourceManager directly for the resource.  For the sake of backwards
/// compatibility, the ResourceManager must have some way of creating a
/// LoopsFileData object from the command line.  If someone is using the loop modeling
/// application, but does not provide a resource definition, then the
/// LoopsFileFallbackConfiguration (derived from %FallbackConfiguration)
/// will be called upon by the ResourceManager for three things:
/// 1) the name of the ResourceLoader to use to create the resource ("LoopsFile"),
/// 2) the locator_id for the Resource (which it goes to the command line to find), and
/// 3) a ResourceOptionsOP which is either null (meaning "use the default") or is in
/// some way initialized with options from the command line.  With these three bits, the
/// ResourceManager will go the appropriate ResourceLoader and request the construction
/// of the Resource as usual, opening the file using the default ResourceLocator
/// (for the JD2ResourceManager, this is the FileSystemResourceLocator).
