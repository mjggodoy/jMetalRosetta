/// @brief The %FallbackConfigurationFactory is a singleton factory with which
/// FallbackConfigurationCreator objects should be registered.  The "fallback" system
/// serves as a mechanism for preserving command-line functionality even
/// while switching more protocols from requesting resources from the
/// ResourceManager rather than reading directly from the command line.
///
/// When a resource with a particular resource-description string is requested
/// from the ResourceManager, and the ResourceManager does not have any instructions
/// on how to load a resource matching that description, then the ResourceManager
/// will then ask the FallbackConfigurationFactory for help.  The
/// FallbackConfigurationFactory can first answer "does this resource description
/// match any resource descriptions for which you have a registered
/// FallbackConfigurationCreator?" and if the answer is "yes", then the
/// ResourceManager can request that FallbackConfigurationCreator and ask,
/// first, if it is able to construct a resource (FallbackConfigurations
/// often read from the command line, and it's possible that the required
/// flags have not been put on the command line), and if so, then request data
/// from the FallbackConfiguration needed to contruct that resource.
