/// @brief The %FallbackConfigurationCreator plays the role in the
/// ResourceManager framework of gluing a "resource_description" string
/// and a FallbackConfiguration together.

/// @details The ResourceManager looks to a FallbackConfiguration when a resource is
/// requested by a resource description string but no resource definition file
/// has been provided.  In such a case, the FallbackConfiguration will provide
/// the information the ResourceManager needs to create the resource.  It's the
/// %FallbackConfigurationCreator's job to inform the ResourceManager which
/// FallbackConfiguration to talk to.
///
/// Each class derived from the %FallbackConfigurationCreator will
/// instantiate a single FallbackConfiguration and act to pair a string,
/// a "resource description," with that FallbackConfiguration.  For example
/// "LoopFile" as a resource description will be paired by the
/// LoopFileFallbackConfigurationCreator with the LoopFileFallbackConfiguration.
/// Multiple resource descriptions can be paired with a single FallbackConfiguration.
