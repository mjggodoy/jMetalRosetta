/// @brief A data map designed to help create hierarchies with complicated
/// shared data requirements.
///
/// @details To explain what exactly this class is supposed to do, consider the
/// following mover hierarchy (which comes from the loop modeling framework and
/// was the actual motivation for this code):
///
/// <pre>
///                  A                         ~
///                  |                         ~
///   +-------+------+------+------+           ~
///   |       |      |      |      |           ~
///   B       C      D      E      F           ~
///          / \    / \           / \          ~
///         G   H  I   J         K   L         ~
///                |   |        /   /|\        ~
///                M   N       O   P Q R       ~
/// </pre>
///
/// To explain this diagram a little, each letter corresponds to a mover.  The
/// movers are mostly of different classes, although they all inherit from the
/// same abstract base class.  This whole hierarchy is constructed by A.  When
/// A.apply() is called, it calls B.apply(), C.apply(), D.apply(), E.apply(),
/// and F.apply() in that order.  When B.apply() is called, it calls G.apply()
/// and H.apply(), and so on.  If you are interested in seeing exactly how this
/// hierarchy is implemented, here are the classes the letters correspond to:
///
/// A. protocols::loop_modeling::LoopModeler
/// B. protocols::loop_modeling::utilities::PrepareForCentroid
/// C. protocols::loop_modeling::LoopBuilder
/// D. protocols::loop_modeling::LoopProtocol
/// E. protocols::loop_modeling::utilities::PrepareForFullatom
/// F. protocols::loop_modeling::LoopProtocol
/// G. protocols::kinematic_closure::KicMover
/// H. protocols::loop_modeling::refiners::MinimizationRefiner
/// I. protocols::loop_modeling::utilities::LoopMoverGroup
/// J. protocols::loop_modeling::utilities::LoopMoverGroup
/// K. protocols::loop_modeling::utilities::LoopMoverGroup
/// L. protocols::loop_modeling::utilities::LoopMoverGroup
/// M. protocols::kinematic_closure::KicMover
/// N. protocols::loop_modeling::refiners::MinimizationRefiner
/// O. protocols::kinematic_closure::KicMover
/// P. protocols::loop_modeling::refiners::RepackingRefiner
/// Q. protocols::loop_modeling::refiners::RotamerTrialsRefiner
/// R. protocols::loop_modeling::refiners::MinimizationRefiner
///
/// This hierarchy had the following shared data requirements:
///
/// 1. Everything in the hierarchy has to share a loops object.
/// 2. A has to know about centroid and fullatom score functions.
/// 3. B, D, and all their children have to use the centroid score function.
/// 4. F and all its children have to use the fullatom score function.
/// 5. A has to provide a default task factory to all its children.
/// 6. Only P and Q have any use for a task factory, and they may want to
///    override the default provided by A.
///
/// Many of these requirements have a similar form: movers higher in the
/// hierarchy must be able to provide default attributes to all their children,
/// and movers lower in the hierarchy must be able to override those defaults.
/// This class supports that pattern by being a data map that asks its parent
/// for missing values.
///
/// More specifically, this class stores two pieces of information: a DataMap
/// and a pointer to a parent HierarchicalDataMap.  The DataMap provides the
/// basic attribute lookup capability: it's just a string to owning pointer
/// map.  The parent pointer allows the HierarchicalDataMap to recursively
/// access default values from parent maps for key that aren't in it's own
/// DataMap.
///
/// Going back to the example hierarchy above: A needs to provide a default
/// task factory that P and Q can override.  To accomplish this, we start by
/// giving all the objects in the hierarchy HierarchicalDataMap objects that
/// have been properly connected to their parents.  Then A sets the default
/// "task_ops" attribute in it's own HierarchicalDataMap as soon as it's
/// constructed.  P and Q provide convenience methods like get_task_ops() and
/// set_task_ops() to allow the "task_ops" field of their HierarchicalDataMaps
/// to be accessed publicly.  Since the data maps in P and Q are connected to A
/// via L and F, the attributes stored in A will serve as defaults for P and Q.
///
/// It's worth noting that in this example, it is also possible to get the
/// right behavior by putting a task operations data member in the shared base
/// class.  However, this is a poor solution for two reasons.  The first is
/// that it requires many classes that have no need for task operations to have
/// a task operations attribute.  Second, it requires that you write the
/// default logic for each attribute that needs it, which is a duplication of
/// effort.  Using HierarchicalDataMap addresses both of these problems.
///
/// When using this class to help build a hierarchy like the one illustrated
/// above, you might find it useful to move public accessor methods (like
/// get_task_ops() and set_task_ops() in P and Q) into a reusable mixin class.
/// This takes a little bit of C++ template magic, because you have to use the
/// "curiously recurring template pattern" (CRTP).  But you can see how this
/// works by looking at protocols::loop_modeling::RepackingLoopMover (P in the
/// example) and protocols::loop_modeling::utilites::TaskFactoryMixin (the
/// mixin class).
