/// @file basic/svd/SVD_Solver.hh
///
/// @brief SVD solver class
///
/// @details Solve over-determined set of linear equation to minimize ||A x - b||^2, using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) method.
///
/// @param
/// Specify the size of the problem in the constructor (M is the number of equations, N is the number of parameters to fit)
/// M MUST be larger or equal than N.
/// Use the set_* functions to set the data vector b and the matrix A.
/// Use the run_* functions in the correct order to solve your system (run_decomp_svd, then run_solve_svd)
/// You can score the result with run_score_svd_on_matrix
/// You can retrieve your solution with get_svd_solution.
///
/// @return
/// The score of the fitting : sqrt( ||A x - b||^2 ) with run_score_svd_on_matrix();
/// The fitted vector x with get_svd_solution();
///
/// @remarks
/// Calls in a wrong order of the functions will abort the program (i.e. if you try to solve the problem before you set a matrix A)
/// Once the matrix is decomposed, you can change the vector b and solve Ax=b with the new vector. (That's why those 2 functions are separated)
/// The matrix A is necessary to calculate the score (argument of run_score_svd_on_matrix), but the matrix A is not stored within
/// the SVD_solver object, so make sure you have it available when scoring (this is done on purpose for speed up)
/// Is it possible to speed up calculations by using ObjexxFCL::FArraynD.index() call? ObjexxFCL doc is not really clear.
