pose_scoring.py

This script displays methods for scoring pose objects and extracting score date.
The Python syntax presented here is useful for quick investigation of
Rosetta scores, including numerous statistical properties.

Instructions:

1) ensure that your PDB file is in the current directory
2) run the script:
    from commandline                        >python D020_Pose_scoring.py

    from within python/ipython              [1]: run D020_Pose_scoring.py

# THE BASIC PROTOCOL, pose_scoring

"""
This sample script is setup for usage with
    commandline arguments,
    default running within a python interpreter,
    or for import within a python interpreter,
        (exposing all methods below)

The method pose_scoring:
1.  scores the pose using the default fullatom (fa) ScoreFunction by:
        a.  using get_fa_scorefxn
        b.  using create_score_function
        c.  using create_score_function and supply patch as second argument
        d.  using create_score_function and patching it after-wards
        e.  creating an empty ScoreFunction and manually setting the weights
2.  outputs the ScoreFunction evaluations
3.  obtains the pose's per-residue total scores
4.  obtains the non-zero weights of the ScoreFunction, the active ScoreTypes
5.  obtains the pose's per-residue energies for all active ScoreTypes
6.  obtains the hydrogen bond information
7.  creates a dictionary for per-residue hydrogen bond information
8.  approximates the pose's radius of gyration
9.  outputs the pose information
10. outputs information on the requested residues

# INTERPRETING RESULTS

"""
This sample script is strictly to provide example syntax, it does not perform
any significant protocol and merely extracts data from a Pose and from scoring
information. The sample method and PDB file presented with this sample script
work without error. Since Rosetta is not entirely robust to all PDB files,
several problems can occur if the methods are modified or used with new
PDB files. The most likely problems could be:
    -if the input PDB file cannot be loaded into PyRosetta
    -if the residues to specifically investigate do not exist
    -if the input pose is not fullatom

# Obtaining and Editing PDB files
"""
PDB files are the keys to structural Bioinformatics and structure prediction.
PDB files are most easily obtained from the RCSB website but may contain
variability which makes them incompatible with PyRosetta. To obtain a new
PDB file:

1) locate your protein of interest at http://www.pdb.prg/
2) download the PDB file, using a browser this includes:
    a. clicking "Download Files" on the upper right
    b. clicking "PDB File (text)", the second option
3) Manually edit the file to remove lines which may hinder PyRosetta
    (use PyMOL, grep, awk, Python, Biopython, or whatever technique you prefer)

Methods for downloading and generically "cleaning" PDB files should accompany
future PyRosetta releases.
