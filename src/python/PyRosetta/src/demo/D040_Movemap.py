movemap.py

This sample script explains the MoveMap object frequently changed in PyRosetta
protocols. It demonstrates how to set up a proper MoveMap for basic
applications and applies this on backbone torsion minimization.

Instructions:

1) ensure that your PDB file is in the current directory
2) run the script:
    from commandline                        >python D040_Movemap.py

    from within python/ipython              [1]: run D040_Movemap.py

# WARNING
"""
Yes, this script should (conventionally) be called move_map.py however the
MoveMap object is frequently implemented against this convention (for example
MinMover.movemap) and as such, I decided to continue this tradition since it
matches the syntax.

This sample script is setup for usage with

The method movemap:
1.  setup a MoveMap for minimizing the pose score by altering the backbone
        torsions of a set of residues
2.  perform minimization
        -display the change in score
        -write the minimized pose to a PDB file (minimized.pdb)

    # MoveMap
    # a MoveMap encodes what data is allowed to change in a Pose, referred to as
    #    its degrees of freedom
    # a MoveMap is separate from a Pose and is usually required by a Mover so
    #    that the correct degrees of freedom are manipulated, in this way,
    #    MoveMap and Pose objects often work in parallel
    # several MoveMap's can correspond to the same Pose
    # a MoveMap stores information on a per-residue basis about the
    #    backbone ({phi, psi, omega}) and chi ({chi_i}) torsion angle sets
    #    the MoveMap can only set these sets of torsions to True or False, it
    #    cannot set freedom for the individual angles (such as phi free and psi
    #    fixed)
    # the MoveMap has no upper-limit on its residue information, it defaults to
    #    all residues (up to residue 99999999) backbone and chi False
    # you can view the MoveMap per-residue torsion settings by using the
    #    MoveMap.show( Pose.total_residue() ) method (the input argument is the
    #    highest residue to output, it does not support viewing a range)

# INTERPRETING RESULTS

"""
Cycle through the structures exported to PyMOL to observe the structural change
performed by backbone minimization.
The PDB file output demonstrating minimization and MoveMap degree of freedom
selection should be compared to the original PDB file (test_in.pdb for the
sample case).
Notice that the backbone residues of the "middle" section have moved slightly.
Since only the backbone changed, PyMOL's cartoon representation (and other
similar views) displays this change well. Even though only the "middle" residue
torsions have changed, the downstream residue coordinates have moved while the
upstream residue coordinates remain stationary. Try comparing the minimization
using successive states of the same PyMOL object or by loading in the PDB files
separately and aligning them.
