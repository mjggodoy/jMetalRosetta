# A GENERAL EXPLANATION

"""
packer_task.py

This sample script explains the PackerTask object frequently changed in
PyRosetta protocols. It demonstrates how to set up a proper PackerTask for
basic applications and applies this for sidechain repacking and design. Two
additional methods are provided for generating resfiles for a PackerTask.

Sidechain packing (or just packing) refers to the concept of protein sidechain
conformations attaining a physically stable structure dependent upon all
residues involved (such as the hydrophobic core). Van der Waals forces provide
the constraints defining what sets of sidechain conformations are or are not
sufficiently "packed" (hydrophobic separation). Since Rosetta sidechain
conformation selection uses a fixed backbone, at least in any individual step,
the process of selecting low scoring sidechain conformations (those obeying
Van der Waals constraints) is termed "packing" or "repacking".


Instructions:

1) ensure that your PDB file is in the current directory
2) run the script:
    from commandline                        >python D050_Packer_task.py

    from within python/ipython              [1]: run D050_Packer_task.py

    #    enumerating all possibilities for all sidechains simultaneously is

# INTERPRETING RESULTS

"""
The PDB files output demonstrating the PackerTask for packing and design
should be compared to the original PDB file (test_in.pdb for the sample case).
Notice that packed.pdb has the original backbone conformation but many of
the sidechain conformations differ. For test_in.pdb, this packing step provides
the quickest visible change in the score value.
Notice that designed.pdb has the original backbone conformation but the "middle"
residues have different amino acids than the original sequence. If you use a
PDB file other than test_in.pdb, these amino acids may preserve their identity,
it depends on their score evaluation in PyRosetta and it there is an accessible
lower score rotamer.
Since a PackerTask can set options to due packing on some residues and design
on others simultaneously, it is IMPERATIVE that you isolate your desired move.
For example, if the design performed in the sample script above also repacked
several other residues, would the score change be due to repacking or design?
Would the amino acids "mutated" have their lowest scoring conformation? This
confounding possibility is why structures must be made Rosetta friendly before
applying a protocol. Many Rosetta "moves" may lower the score due to trivial
structural changes instead of the protocol of interest.
In some cases, design may change the rotamer, but not the amino acid identity,
indicating that the new rotamer has the lowest score of all available rotamers.
