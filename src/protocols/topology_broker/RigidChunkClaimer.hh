/// the rigid chunk to keep its integrity will need jumps, the claimer will reuse jumps if somebody else claims them,
/// or submit in finalize_claims his own jumps, if not enough jumps are present.
/// in "bExclusive_ mode" the RigidChunk will reclaim any jump claim that is useful and wihin the rigid region. (i.e., foreign claim is dissallowed but own claim with same residues is issued --- in this way the claimer uses e.g., beta-sheet jumps, where they are suggested
/// the input pose is used to initialize the rigid region ( via copying of internal coordinates )
///  e.g., a hole in the structure shouldn't pose a problem, since we basically copy the atom-tree.
