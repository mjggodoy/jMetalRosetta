/// @brief The %JD2ResourceManager is the ResourceManager that should be used when
/// running protocols under the jd2 JobDistributor.
///
/// @details The purpose of the ResourceManager is to disentangle the process of
/// feeding protocols with Resources they need from the job distribution system in
/// which they run.  When protocols request a resource under the ResourceManager,
/// they do so without knowing what kind of ResourceManager they are communicating
/// with.  Protocols that are designed to run under JD2 could conceivably be run
/// under any other job management scheme (e.g. a complicated MPI protocol).  It's
/// the job of the %JD2ResourceManager to determine the right resource to deliver
/// to a protocol, and the context that the %JD2ResourceManager uses to make that
/// decision is the job.  E.g., when a protocol asks for the "native" (the Pose of
/// the native structure), the %JD2ResourceManager looks up what job is currently
/// running and then delivers the (single) native Pose for that job.
///
/// The %JD2ResourceManager is meant to work with the JD2ResourceManagerJobInputter.
/// Jobs are defined in an input XML file and for each of the jobs that are defined,
/// resources can be mapped to them.  Resources are also declared in an XML file
/// and may be declared in the same XML file as the Jobs or in a different XML file.
/// The format of this XML file is specified in full between the documentation
/// in the JD2ResourceManagerJobInputter class and three functions that are
/// documented and implemented in this class.
///
/// The %JD2ResourceManager keeps track of which resources are used by which jobs
/// and keeps track of what jobs have completed.  It allocates a Resource the first
/// time that resource is requested by a protoocol, and it deallocates that Resource
/// when all jobs that require that resource have finished.  Thus a protocol that
/// needs an expensive-to-create resource (e.g. a set of 9-mers) can load that
/// resource once and then have that resource shared between all of the jobs that
/// require that resource (e.g. 10K abinitio trajectories) *without having to do
/// any legwork itself.*  If you have 100K abinitio trajectories for 10 different
/// targets, they could all be run in a single job. (Note: as of 9/2013, abinitio
/// does not work with the jd2 or the ResourceManager but it should!)
///
/// The main consequence of relying on the ResourceManager to hand resources to jobs
/// is that jobs which require different resources (usually specified on the command
/// line, and therefore requiring that each job run in a separate process) now can
/// be run together in a single process.  For MPI jobs, this is a major improvement,
/// especially in constructing benchmarks, where many separate, (possibly short)
/// jobs need to be run.
///
/// (Because Resources are not constructed until they are requested, resources can
/// be declared and never used; you can give a resource file that describes every
/// resource you use in every job, and a job declaration file that only uses one
/// of those resources.)
