/// @details This JobDistributor is intended for machines where you have a large number of processors.
/// two dedicated processes are used to handle JobDistribution and File-IO.
/// all other processes (higher rank ) are used for computation.
/// the file_buf_rank_ process runs the MpiFileBuffer which is at the receiving end of all ozstream output that is rerouted via MPI from the
/// slave nodes.
/// This means all slaves write to the same file without FileSystem congestion and interlacing in the file -- IO is handled from a single dedicated process
/// The other dedicated process (master_rank) runs the actual JobDistributor
/// and is only used to distribute jobs to slaves and receive their notification of successful or failed execution
/// in case you have only a small number of processors you can put say 10 MPI processes on 8 processors to get optimal CPU usage.
