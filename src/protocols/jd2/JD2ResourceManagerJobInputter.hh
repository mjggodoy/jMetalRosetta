/// @brief The %JD2ResourceManagerJobInputter works with the JobDistributor to define
/// the set of jobs that are to be executed.  It reads the list of jobs and the set
/// of resouces they require from one or more XML files.
///
/// @details The %JD2ResourceManagerJobInputter, in its fill_jobs() method, reads
/// a set of XML files that are provided on the command line with the
/// "jd2::resource_definition_files" flag.  Multiple files can be given with this
/// flag, and each will be read in the order that they are given. e.g.
/// -jd2::resource_definition_files file1.xml file2.xml
///
/// The XML file format for defining jobs is structured into blocks
/// of declarations of objects of the same type.  The blocks may be specified
/// in any order and may be repeated as many times as is necessary.
/// For example, it is useful to first declare a DatabaseConnection resource
/// in a Resources block before then declaring a DatabaseResourceLocator object
/// (which requires a database connection) in a ResourceLocators block, before
/// then declaring resources in a second Resources block which may rely on the
/// DatabaseResourceLocator for their creation.  The key is that the data is
/// processed in the order in which it is declared.  If a Resource lists a
/// ResourceLocator that isn't declared until later in the file, the
/// %JD2ResourceManagerJobInputter will exit with an error message; it will not
/// wait until the entire file has been read to try and resolve whether the
/// requested ResourceLocator will eventually be declared.
///
/// The structure of this XML file is given below.
/// \verbatim
/* (<--- please ignore this; it is merely an artifact of writing doxygen)

<JD2ResourceManager>
<ResourceLocators>
... ResourceLocator definitions go in this block
</ResourceLocators>
<ResourceOptions>
... ResourceOption definitions go in this block
</ResourceOptions>
<Resources>
... Resource definitions go in this block
</Resources>
<Jobs>
Job definitions go here.  Currently the structure is:
List a) options and b) resources that are used by all jobs
List c) individual jobs
List options and resources for an individual job
or,
Provide d) a table of jobs and the resources that go with them
from a database.

a) Give a command line option that will apply to all jobs.
<Option optionname=value/>
Each option's name must be given with full namespacing.  (This hopefully will change)
E.g.: if you want to set the -ex1 flag to true, you must pass it as
"packing:ex1=1"
with exactly one colon between the namespace (packing) and the flag (ex1).

NOTE: Not all command line options are currently controlled by
the ResourceManager.  Check first if the option you're interested
in providing is controlled by the ResouceManager by looking...
(APL note to self: figure out where someone should look to tell
if an option is controlled by the ResourceManager)

b) Give a resource that should be used by all jobs
<Data desc=resource_description resource_tag=resource_name/>
* where resource_description is the string that a protocol will use to find the desired resource
e.g. "native", and
* where resource_name is the string that was given as a name to some previously-declared
resource.
or
<Data desc=startstruct pdb=pdbfilename/>
* where pdbfilename is the string that identifies a particular pdb located on the file system
or
<Data desc=startstruct pdb=pdbidentifier locator=locator_tag/>
* where pdbidentifier is a string that identifies a particular pdb, and
* where locator_tag is a string that was given as a name to some previously-declared
ResourceLocator.
E.g., if the given locator_tag names a DatabaseResourceLocator, then the pdbidentifier
will be used to construct an SQL query that rerieves a pdb-file string from a database.

c) List individual jobs
<Job name=jobname nstruct=number>
* where name=jobname is optional and allows you to control the name given to a job
and thus to the name of the output structures the job creates.  If no name is given
then the name will be taken from the "startstruct" data for this job.
And,
* where nstruct=number is optional and allows you to control the number of times this
job is to be performed.  If this is not provided, then the number of iterations is
set to 1.  number should be an integer string, e.g. "nstruct=100"

Note: All jobs must have a "startstruct" specified, either individually for the
given job, or through the Data block above that applies to all jobs.  If the
startstruct is given in the Data block above that applies to all jobs, then each
individual job needs to be given a different jobname.

provide options for this job
<Option optionname=value/>
* where the format for optionname and value are exactly as described above

provide the resources for this job
<Data desc=resource_description resource_tag=resource_name/> or
<Data desc=startstruct pdb=pdfilename/> or
<Data desc=startstruct pdb=pdbidentifier locator=locator_tag/>
* where the formats for these three types of resource statements are
exactly as described above
</Job>

d) Provide a table of jobs from a database
<JobsTable sql_command=command database_resource=dbresource/>
* where command is a string representing an SQL query, and
* where dbresource is the name for a previously-declared database-connection resource
connection resource.
Each row of the jobs table should have one of the following formats
job_name, 'Resource', desc, resource_tag
job_name, 'Option', option_key, option_value
* desc: A job-agnostic description for a resource like 'native' or 'symm_data'
that can be referenced in the protocol.
* resource_tag: The tag of a resource described in the <Resources/> block.
* option_key: An optionally namespaced option key (string) for the options
system like 'in:file:native'
* option_value: A value or list of values that processed into the option system
</Jobs>
</JD2ResourceManager>
