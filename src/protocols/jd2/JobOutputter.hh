	/// @brief constructor -- reads cmd-line to initialize evaluators
	JobOutputter();

	~JobOutputter() override;

	/// @brief this function is meant to be redefined in child classes to allow for flushing of memory buffers.
	/// Here's the long version: The SilentFileJobOutputter wanted to buffer output, but needed to guaruntee that
	/// the output would be flushed at end of runtime.  The original implementation was to A) bend over backward to ensure
	/// that the destructor was run (JobOutputter lives inside static JobDistributor, which was previously not destructed
	/// because it's static) and B) flush the buffers in the destructor.  This caused a problem because the buffer-flushing
	/// tried to use the Tracers, which had already been destructed...boom crash.
	///
	/// New solution: re-forbid use of destructors within the static JobDistributor system, and create a flush
	/// function to force this stuff out.  So here it is:
	virtual void flush();

	//////////////////////////////creating output functions/////////////////////////////////////////

	/////////////////////////////////state of output functions/////////////////////////////////

	/// @brief this function is not used for output, but it belongs here since it needs to check
	/// the same output locations as the class normally writes to.  This class checks wherever
	/// output goes to see if the job's expected output already exists (on disk or whatever).
	/// This is the most basic form of checkpointing.
