/// @details This function reads one of two files from the command line

/// the set of residues on the scaffold to consider as launch-points
/// for the geometric constraints (e.g. to consider as part of the
/// the catalytic core in an enzyme). The file meanings and formats are below.
///
/// 1. A list of residue id's to consider for all of the geometric constraints.
/// Such a file can be generated for a scaffold and then used along side any
/// enzyme-design .cst file.  It is scaffold dependent and constraint-file
/// independent.  The file should list the residue indexes for the scaffold
/// on one or more lines.  The file format does not support comments.
/// Residue id's start counting at 1; the input pdb resids are ignored.
/// (It's best to renumber your scaffold resids starting from 1 to avoid confusion)
///
/// Example.
/// <begin file>
/// 104 106 108 109 117 118 137 139 143 144 36 6 85 87 88 89 91 92 97
/// <end file>
///
/// 2. A list for each geometric constraint of the residues to consider.
/// Such a file allows the user to focus on particular residues for certain
/// geometric constraints for a particular scaffold.  Such a file should be
/// depends on both the scaffold and the match constraint file and cannot
/// be generalized across either multiple scaffolds or multiple constraint files.
/// The first line of the file begins with N_CST, followed by the number of geometric
/// contraints.  This must match the number of geometric constraints in the .cst file.
/// On each subsequent line, the geometric constraint ID is given, followed by
/// a colon and then followed by all of the residue ID's that should be considered
/// for that geometric constraint.  Each geometric constraint must appear on one
/// line in the file, though they may be listed in any order.  The file format does
/// not support comments.
/// flo jan 2010: it is also possible to specify that all positions in the scaffold
/// can be used for a certain constraint. see the example for cst 4 below
/// Example.
/// <begin file>
/// N_CST 3
/// 1: 9
/// 3: 9
/// 2: 6 7 9 11 12 14 15 17 18 21 22 23 25 26 38 40 43 46 47 49 53 54 57 60 61
