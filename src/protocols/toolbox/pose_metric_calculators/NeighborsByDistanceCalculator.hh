/// @file /src/protocols/toolbox/PoseMetricCalculators/NeighborsByDistanceCalculator.hh
/// @brief NeighborsByDistanceCalculator can determine all the neighbors of a residue within a certain distance.  The pose does not have to have been scored (have a full Energies object).  It uses the PointGraph tools to find neighbors.  There is probably a much more sophisticated way to do this with existing Graph tools but I don't know what it is.

/// @details this calculator determines the number and resids of residues within X angstroms of the given residue.  Its intended purpose is the backend for a TaskOperation that allows one to construct a PackerTask based on neighborhoods around a set of particular residues.  (It combines with a NeighborhoodByDistanceCalculator for that purpose).  It can return the identity of its seeded central residue and distance (just get functions) and calculate the neighbors and count of neighbors around that residue within that distance.  It uses the PointGraph class to do this; if you have a better/faster implementation please code it up and replace this one.  Note that returned data is INCLUSIVE of the central residue - it is part of the count and part of the std::set.
