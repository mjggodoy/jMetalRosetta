/// @brief
/// Compare the sequences between a native and designed protein
///
/// @details
/// This is an implementation taken from Ron Jacak, Douglas Renfrew, Matt O Mera.
/// The main function that is called is the get_sequence_recovery() function. You can
/// pass this function a list of native pdbs and designed pdbs, or just 1 native and 1
/// designed pdb. The sequence recovery will be output in a file called sequencerecovery.txt
/// along with a substitution matrix in a file called submatrix.txt
///
///
/// @references
/// "Native sequences are close to optimal" paper
///
///
/// @author
/// Ron Jacak,
/// Douglas Renfrew (renfrew@nyu.edu) ( added rotamer recovery, cleanup )
/// Steven Combs (moved it into a general use class)
