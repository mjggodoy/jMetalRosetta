/// @file /src/protocols/toolbox/CalcInterNeighborGroup.hh
/// @brief This calculator is meant for finding interfaces between protein domains - like protein-protein interfaces but within a protein.  It's more flexible than that, though.  You define groups of residues within a protein (say, the N and C terminal domains).  You then define which pairs of groups you are interested in.  This calculator returns the union of the sets of residues at the interfaces between these domains/groups.  This calculator contains a superset of the functionality of some of the other calculators, but is less efficient in simple cases.  The pose does NOT have to have been scored.

/// @details This is complicated, so pay attention.  You define groups of residues within a protein (say, the N and C terminal domains).  You then define which pairs of groups you are interested in.  This calculator returns the union of the sets of residues at the interfaces between these domains/groups.  Functionally it is intended for "interface design" at the non-chainbreak interface between domains of multidomain proteins.  It contains a superset of the functionality of some of the other calculators (so I'll be obsoleting them, maybe?).  The pose does NOT have to have been scored.
