/// @brief Convert a pose to fullatom mode for high-resolution loop modeling.
///
/// @details Before we start high-resolution loop modeling, we need to make
/// sure that all the residues in the pose have sidechains.  There are three
/// ways this could happen.  This first is that the pose is already in fullatom
/// mode and we don't have to do anything.  This is important to check, because
/// we don't want to mess anything up if low-resolution loop modeling was
/// skipped.  The second is by copying sidechains from the original structure,
/// except for those in regions where the backbone was moved, which have to be
/// repacked.  This is the default action.  The third option, which has to be
/// explicitly requested, is to simply repack everything.
