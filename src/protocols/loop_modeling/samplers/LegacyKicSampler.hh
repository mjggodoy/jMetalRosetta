/// it is not written as well and is therefore much harder to understand and
/// maintain.  Largely for this reason, development will shift towards the new
/// implementation and the old one will grow more and more out of date.  This
/// sampler was written to compare the two algorithms and is only meant to be a
/// debugging tool.  However, it may be useful in the short term while features
/// like next-gen KIC are still being ported to the new implementation.
