/// @brief Represent the types of fold tree supported by LoopMover.
/// @details This enum supports the bitwise `and` and `or` operators.  Strictly
/// speaking, this is an abuse of enum because both operators can return values
/// that are not contained in the enum.  But this design meets two key
/// requirements.  First, programmers have to work with the enumerated values.
/// Second, bitwise logic can be used to easily combine flags and to determine
/// how composite requests should be satisfied.

/// @brief Base class for loop-sampling algorithms.
/// @details Classes that inherit from LoopMover can plug into the LoopProtocol
/// framework.  The only method that subclasses need to provide is do_apply().
/// Note that the apply() method itself cannot be overwritten, because
/// LoopMover uses it to do some useful setup and teardown work.  Instead,
/// there are two versions of do_apply() that subclasses may implement.  Both
/// return a boolean to indicate whether or not the move succeeded.  The first
/// version of do_apply() accepts only a Pose and is expected to operate on all
/// of the loops returned by get_loops().  The second version accepts a Pose
/// and a Loop, and is only expected to operate on the given loop.  By default,
/// the first version simply iterates through the loops provided by get_loops()
/// and calls the second version on each one.  This means that if the first
/// version is overwritten, the second version will no longer be called.  If
/// neither method is reimplemented, a runtime error will be thrown.
///
/// LoopMover provides a handful of features that could be useful to a loop
/// sampling algorithm.  As mentioned above, the get_loops() method returns the
/// loops that should be sampled.  There are also a number of methods provided
/// for controlling how the fold tree is setup up.  The request_fold_tree()
/// method can be reimplemented to return an enum telling what kind of fold
/// tree this mover requires.  When apply() is called for the first time, a
/// compatible fold tree will be configured.  This behavior is disabled if
/// trust_fold_tree() is called beforehand, in which case responsibility for
/// constructing a compatible fold tree is passed to the calling code.
