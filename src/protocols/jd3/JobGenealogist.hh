/// @brief The JobGenealogist is meant to manage the annoying / complex / delicate
/// task of keeping track of what jobs belong to which node and what their parents
/// and whether a job has any undiscarded descendants. This task would otherwise fall
/// to the JobQueen, and there are already enough tasks for the JobQueen to manage.
///
/// @details The typical usage scenario is that the JobQueen tells the JobGenealogist
/// I have N nodes and for each node, here is an upper bound on the number of jobs
/// that will be run for this node. It's alright if the JobQueen doesn't have all of
/// that information to start; she can tell the JobGenealogist about new nodes in
/// the JobDAG as she gets to them. (The JobQueen does not need to tell the
/// JobGenealogist about the edges in the JobDAG -- only the nodes). The JG will
/// alot job-index ranges for each node based on the upper bounds. These are the
/// "target ranges."
///
/// For example, if you had a 5 stage protocol where you were going to take the
/// best 10 structures out of those that pass some quality filter that resulted
/// from each stage and use them as seeds for 1000 new jobs (100 replicates for
/// each one), then you would say that each of the 5 nodes has a projected 1000
/// jobs -- but you don't know if there are going to actually be 1000 jobs,
/// because it's possible that only 9 strucures will pass the filters.
///
/// When it is time to begin preparing for stage 2, e.g., the JQ will tell the
/// JG, jobs 150, 221, 388, ..., and 658 will be the parent to 100 replicates
/// using the "append_parents_and_n_replicate_jobs_for_node" function. As results
/// for round 2 trickle in, and the JobQueen filters out the worst ones, she
/// will tell the JG that those jobs have been discarded using the note_job_discarded()
/// function.
///
/// The geneologist needs to be informed of the actual job range for a node if you
/// are not using the "append_parents_..." method. If you have a set of jobs that
/// do not have parents, you can either call the "append_parents_..." function
/// where you pass in a vector of empty vectors, OR you can call
/// set_actual_njobs_for_node.
///
/// The JobQueen can even ask the JG to keep track of the jobs she has handed out
/// for each node using the jobs_remain_for_node and get_next_job_for_node functions
///
/// Perhaps the most important functionality of the JobGenealogist is keeping track
/// of ancestries. If you want to keep hold of intermediate structures so that you
/// can output the structures that led to the most interesting / lowest-energy
/// structures at the end of protocol, then JG will manage the tricky task of telling
/// you which intermidiate structures its safe to discard given that they do not
/// have any descendants that have not been discarded. (If you do go and discard those
/// jobs, make sure to tell the JobGenealogist about it.) The JG can also track which
/// jobs have and have not been discarded. It uses a Discrete Interval Encoding Tree (DIET)
/// to efficiently do so.
