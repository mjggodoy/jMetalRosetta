	/// The Job will return a JobResult at the conclusion of its execution, and the JobResult will
	/// be serialized and sent to the appropriate JobQueen for processing and output.  The Job itself
	/// will be discarded.  Large constant data that might be shared between multiple jobs can be
	/// held by the Job object (or by classes that the Job object holds) but that data should not be
	/// put into the JobResult -- large data should not be repeatedly serialized and shipped between
