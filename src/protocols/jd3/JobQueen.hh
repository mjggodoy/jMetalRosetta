/// @brief The %JobQueen class (think of a queen bee) has quite a few responsibilities:
/// - determining what jobs should be run and representing them as larval job objects
/// - taking a larval job object and maturing it into a fully functional Job that can be run
/// - processing the JobResult produced by a Job when it runs
/// - determining the number of rounds of larval-job creation and job execution that should
///   be performed.
///
/// @details The %JobQueen is responsible for creating all of the LarvalJobs, grouped
/// into "batches" which are dispatched by the JobDistributor; the queen then
/// matures the larval jobs into the mature form (a Job, e.g. a Mover/Pose pair) and
/// gives them up to the JobDistributor to actually execute the work.  The
/// JobDistributor then actually calls the Job's "run" method, which produces a JobResult.
/// It then hands this JobResult (e.g. a Pose or several Poses) back to the %JobQueen for
/// output.  In fact, in MPI contexts, the JobDistributor guarantees that it will hand
/// all of the completed JobResults for a single batch to a single %JobQueen, so that
/// she can compute aggregate statistics (e.g. averaging energies) or can look at the
///  results from that round of jobs and decide which to carry forward into the next
/// round of execution.

	/// command line, then the JobDistributor will write out the XSD to the output file.

	/// @brief JobQueens may optionally define an XSD for their resource definition file
	/// which is fed to their resource manager (if they control one). If the JobDistributor
	/// is awakened with the flag "jd3::output_resource_xsd <output file>" on the command
	/// line, and if the derived JobQueen defines an XSD for resources she uses, then the
	/// JobDistributor will write out the resource definition XSD to the output file.

	/// tells the %JobQueen which node in the JobDAG it is requesting jobs for, and puts
	/// a limit on the number of LarvalJobs that the JobQueen should return.

	/// if the Job were to contain a Pose and a Mover (as the MoverAndPoseJob does), then
	/// so each Mover should be freshly constructed, and if the Pose had been copied
	/// from an existing Pose, must use the Pose's "deep_copy" method (since Pose's
	/// sometimes share non-constant data between them, e.g. the AtomTree observer
