///                  to be folded. Movable's size must match pose.size()
/// @param loops   - Loops to be folded.  Cutpoints specified here must be match the cutpoints found in
///                  the pose. Residues not within any loop should not be folded. Residues contained
///                  in a loop but not in the movable set should not be folded.
/// @throws EXCN_Fold if anything goes wrong in folding. Derived classes should throw this.
