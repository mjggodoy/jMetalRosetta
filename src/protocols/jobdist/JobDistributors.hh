/// Job distributors need to be customized in three different ways:
///  - by cluster architecture (none/Condor, MPI, BOINC, etc)
///  - by local test for job completion (PDB exists, tag already in silent file, etc)
///  - by type of input (single PDB file, pair of PDB files, list of tag IDs, etc)
///
/// Cluster architecture is a GLOBAL COMPILE-TIME decision:  it's handled by scons,
/// it's the same for all executables built at that time, and it should be implemented
/// using ifdef's in this base class, by modifying the next_job() method directly.
///
/// Test for job completion is a PER-EXECUTABLE decision:  it's handled
/// by subclassing BaseJobDistributor and implementing the is_finished() method.
/// BaseJobDistributor will consult is_finished() in whatever way is appropriate
/// for the current cluster architecture to ensure that jobs are not repeated.
///
/// Type of input is handled by templating the job distributor on a Job object.
/// BasicJob has been provided already, but you can subclass it if you need
