general usage:

abinitio.init( pose );
...
while(nstruct) {
abinitio.apply( pose );
}

, with the following
stages, all of which uses a different ScoreFunction based on the cen_std.wts in minirosetta_database:

- Stage 1: large (usually 9mer) randomly selected fragment insertions, only VDW term turned on.
Uses score0.wts_patch and runs for either a maximum of 2000 cycles or until all moveable phi/psi values
have been changed.

- Stage 2: large randomly selected fragment insertions, more score terms turned on. Uses score1.wts_patch
and runs for 2000 cycles.

- Stage 3: uses large randomly selected fragment insertions, although the size of the fragment insertions
is tunable via the set_apply_large_frags( bool ) method. Alternates between score2.wts_patch and score5.wts_patch,
running tunable numbers of 2000-cycle iterations between the two scoring functions.

- Stage 4: uses small (usually 3mer) fragment insertions with the fragment selection based on the Gunn cost for
finding local fragment moves. Runs for 4000-cycles and uses score3.wts_patch.

The class implements the basic abinito approach as known from rosetta++. We tried to set this up, such that
behaviour of the protocol can be changed in many different ways ( see, e.g., FoldConstraints ). To be able to change the
behaviour of the protocol easily the class-apply function and methods called therein (e.g., prepare_XXX() / do_XXX_cycles() ) should
not directly change moves or trials. A reference to the currently used score-function should be obtained by
mc().score_function() ...

Behaviour can be changed in the following ways:

use non-classic FragmentMover  --> eg. not uniformly sampled fragments, but using some weighting
--> large and small moves doesn't have to be 3mers and 9mers... use other movers...
---> or other fragets for the "convenience constructor"
use custom trial classes --> overload update_moves()

change sampling behaviour:
overload prepare_XXX() methods: these are called before the cycling for a certain stage begins
overload do_stageX_cycles() : the actual loops over trial-moves ...

change scoring functions:
overload set_default_scores()
weight-changes effective for all stages: set_score_weight()
