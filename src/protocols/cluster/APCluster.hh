/// @brief Public interface for doing affinity propagation clustering.
///
/// @details Based on Frey and Dueck, "Clustering by Passing Messages Between Data Points", Science 315 (2007).
/// Useful for choosing a set of representative data points (exemplars)
/// out of a large set (e.g. all decoys from a large Rosetta run)
/// given a measure of similarity (e.g. RMSD, maxsub, GDT, ...).
///
/// As I understand it, this procedures tries to maximize the sum of similarities between
/// each data point and its exemplar, while balancing that with total number of clusters.
/// Reasonable measures of similarity would be negative RMSD, log-likelihoods,
/// or squared distance (i.e. squared error), depending on what the points represent.
/// Note there is no requirement for symmetry:  s(i,j) need not equal s(j,i).
/// The self-similarity s(k,k) ("preference") for each point controls the likelihood it will be selected as an exemplar,
/// and thus indirectly controls the total number of clusters.
/// There is no way to directly specify a specific number of clusters.
/// The authors suggest that using the median of all other similarities will give a moderate number of clusters,
/// and using the minimum of the other similaries will give a small number of clusters.
///
/// This implementation is designed for clustering very large numbers of data points
/// with sparse similarity [ s(i,k) = -Inf for most i,k ].
/// Similarities for each input point are kept in a heap so that you can limit to only the L highest for each.
/// (This scheme is quite likely to break symmetry, as some points will have more close neighbors than others.)
/// Alternately, you may choose to do your own pre-filtering and only enter the G globally highest similarities
/// between any points in the data set.
/// Run time (per cycle) is linear in the number of similarities, or O(N^2) in the limit of a dense similarity matrix.
///
/// I follow the conventions of the original paper, where "i" is the index of some generic data point,
/// and "k" is the index of a data point being considered as an exemplar (cluster center).
