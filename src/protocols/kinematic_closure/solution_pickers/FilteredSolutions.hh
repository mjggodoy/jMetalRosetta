/// @brief Apply rama and bump checks to quickly filter out bad solutions.
///
/// @details The rama check only considers the pivot torsions, since it is
/// assumed that the non-pivot torsions were set as desired.  This check
/// employs a Monte Carlo acceptance step, which means that the pivot torsions
/// will really be sampled from a rama distribution (ignoring the inherent
/// geometric biases in the closure algorithm) when this check is enabled.
/// However, note that the rama distribution will be double-counted if the
/// score function also contains a rama term, which it usually does.
///
/// The bump check checks for clashes between the N, CA, C, O, and CB atoms of
/// every residue in the loop versus every other residue in the protein.  This
/// filter is O(n^2) and is much slower than the constant time rama check.  The
/// rama check is also very selective; it usually filters out more than 90% of
/// proposed solutions.  For these reasons, it is important that the rama check
/// be run before the bump check.  You can disable the rama check, but this
/// would probably lead to a noticeable drop in performance.
