/// @brief Make a kinematic closure move that obeys detailed balance.
///
/// @details This class is very conceptually similar to KicMover, so check
/// out its documentation for a general overview of the kinematic closure
/// algorithm.  Here I will just highlight some details associated with making
/// a balanced version of the move.  Detailed balance is a useful property,
/// because it allows a Monte Carlo simulation to recapitulate ensembles with
/// correct equilibrium populations (so long as sampling is good, of course).
/// There are a two reasons why the standard KicMover algorithm does not obey
/// detailed balance.  The first is that the geometry of the closure move
/// itself introduces some inherent bias which has to be explicitly canceled
/// out.  The second is that care needs to be taken to perturb the non-pivot
/// torsions in a way that also obeys detailed balance, as well.
///
/// The add_perturber() method works much like it does in KicMover.  The only
/// conceptual difference is that when the added perturbers are used internally
/// within apply(), perturbers::Perturber::perturb_with_balance() is called
/// instead of perturbers::Perturber::perturb().  This makes it easy to make
/// variants of the perturber algorithms which obey detailed balance.  The
/// set_pivot_picker() method is no different from the KicMover version.
