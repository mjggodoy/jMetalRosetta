/// @brief Base class for moves that can obey detailed balance.
///
/// @details In order to sample a thermodynamic state using a Monte Carlo
/// simulation, the moves must obey detailed balance.  This base class provides
/// a framework for writing moves that can obey this condition.  One
/// interesting method is set_preserve_detailed_balance(), which indicates
/// whether or not detailed balance needs to be obeyed.  This flag makes it
/// possible to implement fancy (but biased) features for use in contexts where
/// rigorous thermodynamic sampling isn't needed.  If the move requires a
/// non-unity proposal ratio to obey detailed balance, it can reimplement
/// last_proposal_density_ratio().  Support for movers that make multiple trial
/// moves under the hood is provided by is_multi_trial() and its related
/// methods.  A number of callbacks, including  initialize_simulation(),
/// observe_after_metropolis(), and finalize_simulation(), are also defined to
/// let the mover react to certain milestones in the simulation.
