	/// This is not a particularly robust system, because it may require several
	/// unrelated observers working in concert to properly reconstitute the
	/// simulation.  In fact, the restart feature in MetropolisHastingsMover is
	/// currently commented out, so this method is never actually invoked.  I
	/// would advise reimplementing this method to utility_exit_with_message() in
	/// any subclasses you write, so that you don't waste time writing an unused
	/// method but so you don't confuse anyone if this feature gets revived in
