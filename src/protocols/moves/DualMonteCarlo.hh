/// @details DualMonteCarlo is a wrapper class around MonteCarlo.  Its original purpose is to allow for Boltzmann scoring a pose in centroid mode while simultaneously tracking a fullatom equivalent.  It should work for any paired poses.  Generally, "DMC_pose" refers to the pose this class tracks, whereas "MC_pose" refers to the one used by the underlying MC object.  While this class contains a MonteCarlo object (by composition, not inheritance); you cannot pass in a MC object to it, nor can you get an OP to that object.  const access to the underlying MC is provided at this time; if you want nonconst access you can write it in but beware that the user can then ruin the bookkeeping!  Also note that I (SML) left the framework in place in comments for a lot of MC's functions within DMC like checkpointing and counters.  Flesh these out if you want them...
