The protocols/moves directory no longer contains Movers that do stuff to the pose.  It is for:

A) The Mover base class and related classes (MoverCreator, etc)

B) control-flow Movers (MoverContainer)

C) Monte Carlo.

Do not put your pose-modifying Movers here, put them in simple_moves instead.

Also, since this is never emphasized enough, DO NOT MODIFY THE MOVER CLASS WITHOUT COMMUNITY APPROVAL!
