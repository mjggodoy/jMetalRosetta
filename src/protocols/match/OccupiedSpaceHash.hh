/// @brief This class keeps track of the active voxels "up until now" with 64 hashes.
///
/// @details
/// Each hash has a slightly shifted definition of the origin, so that points which
/// are close in 6D will end up in the same hash voxel in at least one of these 64 hashes.
/// The amount of data held in this table is intentionally small: a single boolean (32 bits).
/// The meaning is as follows:
/// In the first round of matching constraints, "false" is inserted into each of the hashes
/// for each non-colliding placement of the downstream partner.
/// The map is not altered between the end of the first round and the beginning of the second round.
/// At the end of all rounds besides the first round, the Matcher updates the OccupiedSpaceHash
/// object for each non-colliding placement of the dowstream partner found during that round:
/// for each non-colliding placement of the downstream partner and for
/// each of the 64 hashes, the 6Dofs describing the downstream partner are hashed: if the
/// hash finds an element in the hash table, that element's value is set to "true".
/// At the end of each round past the second round, the entire hash is traversed.  Any element
/// whose value is "false" represents a voxel that failed to find a match during that round. Such
/// elements are deleted from the hash.  Any element whose value is "true" DID get a hit from that
/// round and should remain in the hash.  The element's value is set to "false".
/// After the OccupiedSpaceHash has cleared out the elements which failed to find a match for the
/// previous round, the Matcher may proceed to "clean up" its older hits (from rounds previous to this one)
/// by querying them against the hash map.  Any hit in the Matcher that does not have a corresponding element
/// in any of the 64 hashes of the OccupiedSpaceHash may be deleted, since it cannot form
/// a complete match.
///
/// This class is intended to be accessed by multiple threads but in a controlled way:
/// read access function "match_possible_for_hit_geometry" is accessible to all threads
/// during the "building" stage. However, the functions note_hit_geometry and
/// drop_unsatisfied_voxels should be called by single thread only, and no other thread
/// should try to access the ActiveVoxelHashes object at that time.
