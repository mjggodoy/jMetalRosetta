/// @note The point of these is:
///  @li  Show the file and line number where the exit originates
///  @li  Optionally show a message about why the exit occurred
///  @li  Provide a core dump on Linux/UNIX so a post-mortem backtrace
///       can be performed
///  @li  Provide macro functions to add the file and line for you
/// @note Break on utility::exit when debugging to allow you to
///       get a backtrace from the point of exit
