/// @brief The %FileContentsMap is a class that will minimize the number of times
/// files are accessed from disk.  The first time the contents of a file are
/// requested, it will cache the contents the file in memory as a strings.  All
/// subsequent requests for the contents of that file will then be delivered
/// without having to go to disk.  WARNING: The %FileContentsMap will not update
/// the contents that it holds for a file after the first time it loads it, so if
/// the contents change on disk, the %FileContentsMap will be out of date.
///
/// The %FileContentsMap offers two settings that are both off by default.
///
/// 1) You can set whether it should delete files when they reach a "read limit,"
/// which in turn requires that you first define a read limit for the file.
/// This can prevent the %FileContentsMap from loading too much into memory as
/// long as the utility of a file is expected to be short (i.e. it's read several
/// times in a short period and then never again).  Setting a file's read limit to
/// zero signals that the contents of the file should never be deleted from memory
/// i.e. that it has an infinite read limit. If the contents of a file is requested
/// before read limit has been set, then the read limit is set to zero
/// (i.e. infinity).
///
/// 2) You can set whether it should refuse to load unexpected files.  Before
/// you request the contents of a file, you must provide a read limit (zero is
/// an acceptible value here; see above) for that file, or the %FileContentsMap
/// will throw an exception when you request that file.
