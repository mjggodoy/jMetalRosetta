/// @file   utility/FixedSizeLexicographicalIterator.hh
/// @brief  Class for iterating across all words of a compile-time-known fixed-length, composed of letters from
/// varying alphabets, where each alphabet is represented by its size.  This iteration is
/// performed in lexicographical order.  All allocation of a FixedSizeLexicographicalIterator takes
/// place on the stack, and is therefore much faster than a regular LexigographicalIterator.
