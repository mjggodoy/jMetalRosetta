/// @file   utility/LexicographicalIterator.hh
/// @brief  Class for iterating across all words of a fixed-length, composed of letters from
/// varying alphabets, where each alphabet is represented by its size.  This iteration is
/// performed in lexicographical order.
///
/// E.g, All four letter words from the english alphabet could be iterated across by
/// instantiating an element of this class, handing in its constructor a vector1 of size 4,
/// where each element held 26.  The first word "AAAA" would be represented by "1,1,1,1".
/// The word "MINI" would be represented by the numeral string "13,9,14,9" and would be the
/// 210,912 + 5408 + 338 + 8 = 216,666th word encountered in the iteration.
