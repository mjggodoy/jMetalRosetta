/// @details First automorphism is the identity, [1 2 3 4 ... N]
/// The algorithm works its way through the list of atoms one at a time,
/// for each one trying to pair it with every other possible atom
/// (including itself) that isn't already paired with some earlier atom.
/// To be paired, the atoms need only be of the same chemical type;
/// for efficiency though, we also check that they have the same number of neighbors.
/// We also check that all the edges between the current atom and previously paired atoms
/// also exist between their paired counterparts (a condition for true automorphisms).
/// If we get to a point where we can't find a partner for some atom,
/// we know some earlier pairing is wrong, so we backtrack and try something else.
/// This algorithm would be more natural to represent recursively,
/// keeping state on the stack, but by "flattening" it like this we can use
/// the backtracking machinery to "resume" our search on the next call to next(),
/// thereby iterating over all the possible automorphisms.
/// The vector curr_[] thus takes the place of the stack, and used[] serves
/// to prevent two different atoms from being paired with the same partner simultaneously.
