///
/// @brief Implementation class for abstract class Residue
///
/// @details
/// My understanding of this piece of code comes from various conversations with Oliver Lang, Summer Thyme, and Andrew
/// Leaver-Fay. If the ideas are incorrect, feel free to correct.
///
/// General Overview
///
/// What are patches? Patches are modifications to the original amino acid residue types.  These modifications include
/// capping the N and C terminus, adding phosphorylation to residues, etc, etc.  The actual files that are read and used
/// are found in: database/chemical/residue_type_sets/fa_standard/patches
///
/// All of these patches are read when ResidueTypeSet is instantiated and are applied to all residues that are
/// identified as needing to be patched.  (Identification of residues is explained later.)  Identification of residues
/// that need to be patched varies by what is in the actual patch file.  For example, peptide residues that are C and/or
/// N termini are patched with the N and/or C terminus patches, which are defined in the files NtermProteinFull.txt and
/// CtermProteinFull.txt.
///
/// Overview of a Patch File
///
/// Let's look at a patch file to see what goes on.  The file we are looking at is NtermProteinFull.txt.  The file is
/// shortened to make it easier to read.  Important parts are shown:
///
/// NAME NtermProteinFull  # actual name of the patch
/// TYPES LOWER_TERMINUS   # the type that this patch belongs to.  Types are defined in VariantType.cc/.hh
///
/// # This section is for general selection rules to apply the patch.
/// BEGIN_SELECTOR  # Here is where we define how to select amino acids for the patch.
///                 # Properties/variant types needed for the patch are found between the BEGIN_SELECTOR and
///                 # END_SELECTOR "titles"
/// PROPERTY PROTEIN  # For this patch to apply, the residue must be a protein, as defined in the paramaters file.
/// NOT VARIANT_TYPE LOWER_TERMINUS  # We do not want to patch the variant type LOWER_TERMINUS.  This is because, we do
///                                  # not want to double patch a residue (if the residue is already variant type
///                                  # lower_terminus).
/// END_SELECTOR  # ending the selection process for the patch
///
/// # This section is to modify specific residues that the patch encounters.
/// BEGIN_CASE ## PROLINE  # Within the BEGIN_CASE and END_CASE section is where the residue is modified.
///                        # These are the operations that occur to apply the patch.
/// BEGIN_SELECTOR  # Once again, we are defining what to do in this specific BEGIN_CASE/END_CASE block by using the
///                 # selector.
/// AA PRO        # We only want to modify aa PRO in the following way between the BEGIN_CASE and END_CASE block.
/// END_SELECTOR  # End selection requirements
///
/// ADD_ATOM 1H   Hpol HC 0.24  # straight forward; add atom 1H
/// ADD_ATOM 2H   Hpol HC 0.24
/// ADD_BOND N 1H               # Atoms need bonds; add those bonds.
/// ADD_BOND N 2H
/// SET_POLYMER_CONNECT LOWER NONE # setting a property
///
/// ## totally making these up:
/// SET_ICOOR 1H 120 60 1 N CA C ## like to use CD but CD's parent is CG  # Once new atoms are placed,
/// SET_ICOOR 2H 120 60 1 N CA 1H                                         # new internal cooridantes need to be made.

/// ADD_PROPERTY LOWER_TERMINUS ## implies terminus

///
/// So, let's go through what was put up there.  In general, you name your patch and assign it a type.  Then, you tell
/// the patch system in the BEGIN_SELECTOR / END_SELECTOR block what type of properties that you are looking for to
/// apply the patch.  You then, in the BEGIN_CASE / END_CASE block, add operations to the residue.  You can specify
/// specific selectors within the BEGIN_CASE / END_CASE by having another BEGIN_SELECTOR / END_SELECTOR block.  People
/// generally specify specific amino acids within the BEGIN_SELECTOR / END_SELECTOR blocks within the BEGIN_CASE /
/// END_CASE blocks.  At the end, there is one last BEGIN_CASE / END_CASE with no BEGIN_SELECTOR / END_SELECTOR block.
/// This block is used to specify what to do with the general case, which was defined at the very beginning of the file.
/// A few more details follow below.
///
/// First, you must name your patch.  Then you have to give it a "type".  This type is defined in VariantType.cc/.hh.
/// All the type does is adds a name that can be used later on in different protocols.  It also helps the patch system
/// keep track of what residues are patched with what type.  The type has no magical meaning; it's a name that you give
/// it that is "defined" in the variantType.cc.  In short, it's a name handler.  Once the name and type have been
/// assigned, you must define a general case in which your patch applies.  Generally, this means that you want it to
/// apply to a specific type of aa, or all residues of a specific type or property.  After this block comes the
/// BEGIN_CASE / END_CASE statements.  In these statements, you specify what modifications you want to apply to the
/// residues.  If you have different requirements for different amino acids, you must specify this in a BEGIN_SELECTOR /
/// END_SELECTOR block within the BEGIN_CASE / END_CASE block.  You must specify specific amino acids first, then in a
/// new BEGIN_CASE / END_CASE block, you specify the general modifications defined by the first selector.  Confusing,
/// huh?  The reason for having specific selectors defined before the general case is because..., I don't know.  I
/// suspect it's because of how the file is read in and applied.  Regardless, if you want to do something to a specific
/// amino acid/residue before you get to the general case, you need to have a BEGIN_CASE / END_CASE block with a
/// selector in there before you get to the general BEGIN_CASE / END_CASE block.
///
/// Using Patch Selector to Specify Application of a Patch to Specific Residues
///
/// Woah there!  Now that you know how to use patches, you don't need to go all gun-ho crazy and create a ton of
/// patches. This is because all patches are read when ResidueTypeSet is created and applied.  This creates overhead if
/// you have a ton of patch files.  To circumvent this, someone wrote an option called -chemical:patch_selectors.  I
/// don't know who wrote it, or where it's located, sorry.  This option allows you to create patches that are only
/// loaded when you use the option -chemical:patch_selectors.  To get this to work, you create a patch like normal.
/// Then, in the BEGIN_SELECTOR / END_SELECTOR line, you add a line CMDLINE_SELECTOR <name of command line>.  This
/// means, if you use the CMDLINE_SELECTOR sc_orbitals, your patch will only be loaded if you use the option
/// -chemical:patch_selectors sc_orbitals.  Cool, huh?
///
///
/// Trouble Shooting!!!
/// So, you added a new patch and used the command line selector and nothing happens.  Did you modify VariantTypes.cc to
/// have your new type?  Did you name things correctly?  Did you edit the patches.txt to include your patch?  Are you
/// trying to use a command that does not exist?  Look at patchoperations.cc for commands that exist.  These are all
/// things to check for.
///
/// So, you have added a new patch, and you get segmentation faults.  Most common seg fault for me is in the stub atom.
/// This is because your patch might add atoms/delete atoms that are used in other patches.  In order to fix this, you
/// must modify other patches to include your modifications.  Remember patches are all loaded whenever ResidueTypeSet is
/// instantiated, which is usually near the beginning of a Rosetta protocol when a pose is 1st loaded!  If you have
/// conflicts with other patches in your patch, even if you are using the command line selector, you must resolve those
/// problems.  Write an integration test so that people won't screw up your patches.
