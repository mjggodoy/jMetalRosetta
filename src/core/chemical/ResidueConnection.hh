/// @brief A simple class marking atoms at inter-residue connections.
///
/// Each residue type specifies some number of positions at which it is expecting
/// to form a chemical bond with another residue. Think of them as ports: they are
/// parts of the residue where there are chemical bonds beyond the intra-residue
/// chemical bonds are expected -- places where they can be chemically linked
/// to the outside world.  A conformation::Residue will require that its
/// ResidueConnections be fulfilled by other Residues -- the ResConnID class
/// describes how two residues are connected: e.g., the third ResConnID for
/// residue 10 would say "I connect to residue 58 at residue 58's third residue
/// connection" if residue 10 and residue 58 were disulfide bonded as the disulfide
/// connection id is "3" for two mid-protein cystine residues.  The advantages
/// of separating ResidueConnections from atoms themselves are that 1) it allows
/// multiple residue connections to stem from the same atom -- useful for single-atom
/// residues, such as coordinated metals (Zn, Mg), and 2) it allows one residue
/// to change its set of atoms without invalidating the bond information (e.g. the atom
/// index) on its partner.  For example, if a chain-break were placed between residues
/// 57 and 58, then residue 58 will get an extra C-prev virtual atom, and the index of
/// SG will change.  Residue 10, if it had recorded the SG index would have to find
/// SG's new index.  If instead, the connection point is represented simply as
/// connection point 3, and if the new residue type (the chainbreak disulfide residue)
/// has the same number of residue connections as the original residue type (it will!)
/// then nothing about residue 10 needs to be updated.
