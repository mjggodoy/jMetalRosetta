/// @brief
/// A class that contains orbital parameters
///
/// @details
/// This class contains the "chemical" information for orbitals. This does not contain the actual
/// xyz coordinates of the class which is managed by the conformation/Residue.hh. The orbital_type properties
/// are assigned by the class OrbitalTypeSet which is initiated from the ChemicalManager. Orbital type properties
/// are currently are read in from the file located chemical/orbital_type_sets/fa_standard/orbital_properties.txt.
/// These properties contain the the parameters of distance, but can be modified. Currently this is a very small
/// class that will be added on as more and more properties are identified and added.
/// Note that information about the atomtype is stored along with the orbital type. This may or may not be useful
/// later. Just adding the functionality for the heck of it.
///
/// Orbital type name: the orbital type name contains the hybridization, orbital name, and element associated with the orbital
///
/// Hybridization: the hybridiztion of the atom that the orbital is bonded to (sp, sp2, sp3)
///
/// Orbital Name: the name of the orbital. This usually is p, d, pi, sigma. The orbital name is different than the orbital type name
///
/// Atom Type Name: the type of atom associated with an orbital
///
/// Distance: distance the orbital comes off of the atom. Currently, for residues, the distance is the Bohr radius of Hydrogen+element
///
/// Donor: does the orbital donate electrons? currently not implemented
///
/// Acceptor: is the orbital accept electrons? currently not implemented
///
