# To add a new variant type to Rosetta for use in .params files, patch files,
# and ResidueTypes, simply add a string to this list and run
# update_ResidueType_enum_files.py.

# This is Part 2 of a major refactor of the properties system.

# Comments added inline with a variant type will be converted to C++ comments,
# so please feel free to add clarifications/definitions here.
