/// @brief Enumerates the automorphisms of a residue, which are basically
/// chemical symmetries that affect RMSD calculations.
///
/// @details Common automorphisms include flipping a phenyl ring (think Phe chi2)
/// or rotating a methyl group (or CF3, if you don't care about H).
/// However, they can be much more complicated than that,
/// and some cannot be imitated by rotation about a bond.
/// Examples include labeling a -CF3 clockwise vs. counterclockwise,
/// or swapping the -CF3 branches of -C(CF3)2R.
/// See the ligand of PDB 1PQC for a reasonably complex example.
///
/// Formally, a graph automorphism is an isomorphism of that graph with itself:
/// given a graph G(V,E) and a mapping M that relabels the vertices
/// according to M(v) -> v', then M is an automorphism iff
/// (M(u),M(v)) is an edge if and only if (u,v) is an edge.
/// If the vertices are "colored" (in our case, have atom types), it must also
/// be true that M(v) and v have the same color, for all v in V.
///
/// Thus you can re-label a phenyl ring
///
///   2  3          6  5               6  3
/// 1      4  or  1      4  but not  1      4
///   6  5          2  3               2  5
///
/// because in the last case, there are new bonds 6-3 and 2-5,
/// and missing bonds 6-5 and 2-3.
///
/// See also:  OpenEye's OEChem library and its OERMSD() function.
