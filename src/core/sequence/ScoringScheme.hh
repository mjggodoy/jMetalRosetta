/// @file ScoringScheme.hh
/// @brief abstract base class for representing scoring schemes for alignments.
/// @details ScoringScheme objects contain two scoring rules:
/// - a rule for comparing any character from a sequence to a gap character (usually
/// liste as gap insertion and gap extension, or d and e)
/// - a rule for scoring two elements from a sequence (simply S)
/// Generally the rule for scoring gaps is composed of a gap insertion and a gap
/// extension parameter. It's important to note that alignments derived using
/// the ScoringScheme and Aligner objects are only guaranteed to be optimal if
/// every element of S is bigger than -2 * e.
