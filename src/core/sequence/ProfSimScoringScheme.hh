	/// Published by Yona and Levitt in JMB, 2002 in a paper titled "Within the
	/// Twilight Zone: A Sensitive Profile-Profile Comparison Tool Based on
	/// Information Theory."
	/// @details The basic idea for this score is that it incorporates both
	/// divergence of probability distributions at each position and the significance
	/// of that divergence in order to construct a position-specific
	/// profile-profile score. The divergence score is the J-S divergence between
	/// the two probability distributions at probability position, and the
	/// significance score is the J-S divergence between:
	/// 1. the average of the two probability distributions at this position
	/// 2. a prior probability distribution over all allowed characters at this
	/// position.
	/// J-S divergence between two distributions is defined as:
	/// D( p1, p2 ) = 0.5 * sum( p1[i] * log( p1[i] / p2[i] ) ) +
	///               0.5 * sum( p2[i] * log( p2[i] / p1[i] ) )
