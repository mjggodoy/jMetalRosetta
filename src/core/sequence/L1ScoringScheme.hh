/// @file L1ScoringScheme.hh
/// @brief class definition for a profile-profile scoring scheme for
/// comparing two sequence profiles using the L1 city-block distance.
/// @details Simply based on comparing single profiles from two protein
/// sequences by computing the sum of P(A) - P(B) for all matching probabilities
/// in the profiles A and B. Also includes with affine gap penalties of the form
/// penalty = A + Bk, where A represents the penalty for starting a gap, and B
/// represents the penalty for extending a previously opened gap by k
/// characters.
