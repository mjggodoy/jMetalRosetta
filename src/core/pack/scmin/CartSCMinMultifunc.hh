	/// neighboring residues which will be involved in the minimization:
	/// any residue that's being minimized must have all of its neighbors represented by
	/// edges in the graph.  Active edges and nodes must already have had
	/// "setup_for_minimizing_for_{residue/residue_pair}" invoked: basically,
	/// the CartSCMinMultifunc is absolved of all responsibility for setting up.
