/// @brief
/// Represents the sphere of dots on the vdW surface of an atom, for use in the LeGrand and Merz method of calculating SASA.
///
/// @details
/// For every atom in a protein, the vdW surface is patterned with dots. Each dot has to keep track of how many other
/// residues are "covering" this dot. So, that's 1 character for each dot.  Each character is the count of the number of
/// residues overlapping with this dot.  An assumption we're making here is that a single atom (or really, dot) will never
/// be covered by more than 255 residues.
///
/// In this implementation of the LeGrand and Merz algorithm, we're going to be using 162 dots per atom. Turns out that
/// you can distribute 162 dots evenly on the surface of a sphere.
///
/// This class is extremely simple. The RotamerDots class below does all the work of tying a particular residues atoms to
/// DotSpheres. As a matter of fact, DotSphere doesn't even know what atom it's representing. It just has the one C-style
/// array for the coverage count and that's it.

/// @brief
/// Handles sphere-sphere overlap calculations for the HPatchInteractionGraph.
///
/// @details
/// One big change from the r++ version of this class is that this class now includes all of the information that was
/// previously stored in the RotamerCoords class. Since I'm not storing atoms in trie ordering (perhaps I'll add this
/// later), there is no need to have a separate class for the rotamer coordinates.
///
/// RotamerDots hold DotSphere objects for the atoms of a given Residue (or really, of the current state on some interaction
/// graph Node). Default use of the class will result in RotamerDots objects keeping DotSpheres for every atom of a residue.
/// For the hpatch interaction graph, though, we only care about the SASA of the heavy atoms.  No need to include the
/// hydrogens when looking for hydrophobic patches. By not keeping track of the hydrogens, we save a huge amount of time
/// on computing updates to the SASA score because hydrogen atoms generally make up half of a protein. So I'm adding a
/// boolean flag to the non-default constructor which toggles whether we're tracking SASA of all atoms, or just the heavy
/// atoms.
///
/// Two other big changes being made to this class are that 1) the class will now keep track of two kinds of SASA and
/// 2) it will no longer keep score or score_is_current variables.  The two kinds of SASA the class will keep track of
/// are the standard SASA, and a SASA with polar atom radii extended. The expanded polar SASA will only be kept if a
/// boolean flag is set at construct time.  If not, it will just calculate standard SASA and that's it.  The second
/// change is that this class is now only keeping track of SASA. RotamerDots objects will not be responsible for calculating
/// a score.

/// @brief
/// A singleton class which reads in database SASA radii files and provides accessors for those values to the RotamerDots class.
///
/// @details
/// The RotamerDots class keeps track of the SASA of some rotamer using DotSphere objects and lots of get overlap calls
/// on atoms. The SASA of a given atom (or residue) depends on what radii are used for the atoms. Different program use
/// different sets of radii, and for the hpatch score, the polar atom radii are expanded. Previously RotamerDots objects
/// would have a static vector member variable that represented the particular set of radii being used.  It would also have
/// a second static vector member variable that represented the expanded polar version of the radii.  So, no matter how
/// many instances of RotamerDots objects we created, we only maintained two vectors for the radii.
/// Now, we want to make the RotamerDots class only use one set of radii for the hpatch score: the expanded polar radii.
/// The super easy solution would be to remove all the logic that keeps track of SASA when using the standard radii and
/// make the RotamerDots class only calculate that kind of SASA.  But, there will probably be more uses in the future
/// for a RotamerDots class that can calculate SASA with a standard set of radii than with the expanded polar ones. So, that's
/// where this class comes in. It will read in database files, depending on which set of radii are requested and provide
/// access to that data in some way.
///
/// Let's say we have to create RotamerDots objects for two different sets of SASA radii. When those objects are constructed
/// a pointer to the right set of radii will have to be set. Definitely don't want to copy/store the radii to each instance.
/// If I make it a pointer to this class, then it would only work for one set of radii.  So at RotamerDots construct time
/// we have to ask this class to give us a pointer to the set of radii that are requested. Then only one instance of this
/// class exists, and all RotamerDots objects have pointers set to the radii they care about. What would this change in
/// the RotamerDots API? The get_radius() function would dereference the pointer and index into the vector to get the
/// right radius. This structure is similar to how the ChemicalManager works. But, in that class, the functions return
/// AtomTypeSet objects.
