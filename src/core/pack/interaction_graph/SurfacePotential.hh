/// @brief With the traditional scoring hierarchy, classes like this one are created and accessed via the ScoringManager, which
/// is itself a Singleton class.  These "potential" classes are only created and initialized when the use of the EnergyMethod
/// these classes correspond is encountered.  No point in reading database files for a term if that term is not being used
/// in some score function.  However, the surface energy is used when users specify they want to use it on the command
/// line - NOT via a score function.  The score/energy is done within an interaction graph. One might ask why I just don't
/// put the logic for reading in the database file to the interaction graph init methods.  However, there will be cases
/// where I will want to just score a protein (and not do any design) where I will want the database file to be read in.
/// Scoring doesn't use interaction graphs, so if the code for that was located there, these values would not be read in.
/// Instead, I've decided to implement this as its own separate class.  It uses the Singleton design pattern so the database
/// will only get read in once during a run.
