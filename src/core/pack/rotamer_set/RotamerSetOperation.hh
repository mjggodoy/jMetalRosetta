/// @brief RotamerSetOperations are able to modify the contents of a RotamerSet
/// within the packer immediately after rotamer creation.
///
/// @li They are handed into the packer through a packer task; each ResidueLevelTask
///     keeps its own list of rotamer set operations.
///
/// @li Each RotamerSet, within the build_rotamers() method will iterate across
///     the RotamerSetOperation objects, and call alter_rotamer_set on each
///     element in the ResidueLevelTask's list of rotamer_set_operations.
///
/// @li RotamerSetOperations are visited in the order in which they are appended
///     to the ResidueLevelTasks's operation list.
///
/// @li RotamerSetOperations are unable to correlate changes to rotamer sets across
///     multiple rotamer sets -- they have access to only a single RotamerSet object
///     in their alter_rotamer_set operations.  For correlated alterations to rotamer
///     sets, the (as of yet undefined) RotamerSetsOperation class should be used.
