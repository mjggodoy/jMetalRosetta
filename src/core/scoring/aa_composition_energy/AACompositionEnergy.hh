/// @details This energy method is inherently not pairwise decomposible.  However, it is intended for very rapid calculation,
/// and has been designed to plug into Alex Ford's modifications to the packer that permit it to work with non-pairwise scoring
/// terms.  It has also been modified to permit sub-regions of a pose to be scored.
