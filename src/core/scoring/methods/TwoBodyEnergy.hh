/// The Two Body Energy Method specifies an interface for all two body methods: both
/// long and short range, both context dependent and independent.  Any two body method
/// must implement this interface as well as the EnergyMethod interface.
///
/// In this inheritance heirarchy, a common interface is defined for both context
/// dependent and context independent two body energies.  Context dependent two
/// body energies require a Pose as context to evaluate the energy and so the interface
/// includes a Pose for all energy evaluation calls.
///
/// However, context independent methods do not require a pose, and could
/// conceivably be evaluated in the absence of one.  Is the design compromised
/// by demanding a common interface between context independent and context
/// dependent two-body methods?  Yes and no.  The alternatives are 1) to demand
/// separate, but nearly identical interfaces for ci2b and cd2b classes in which
/// case, the design is compromised by the presence of duplicated code, 2) to
/// use multiple inherritance so that the CI2B class could derive from a
/// two-body interface (shared with the CD2B class) as well as a contex-independent
/// interface (not shared with the CD2B class).  The problem is that most of the
/// "shared" interface involves evaluating energies, and for the CD classes, this
/// requires a Pose.  The truely shared interface between CI and CD classes would
/// be empty and problem 1 has resurfaced.  Moreover, multiple inherritance is
/// difficult to work with and should be avoided.
///
/// What is the drawback of requiring a pose for a CI2B method evaluation?  It makes
/// it less clear to the energy-method user (not the energy-method writer) that the
/// Pose does not play a role in the evaluation of the ci2b energy.  It also makes it
/// possible for the energy-method writer to define a context dependent two body method
/// while declaring it to be context independent: such an act would produce bizzare
/// (wrong) behavior as the innards of the ScoreFunction and the Energies class tried
/// to re-use cached scores that were no longer correct.  So the warning must be made:
///
/// DANGER! DANGER! DANGER!
/// If the EnergyMethod writer declares a method to be context independent, it
/// had better be!
