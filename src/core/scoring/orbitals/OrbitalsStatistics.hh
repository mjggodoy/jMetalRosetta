/// @brief
/// A class for generating statistics from orbitals
///
/// @details
/// This is an attempt to be transparent in how the orbital-hydrogen interactions were converted into
/// a KBP. In general terms, a set of proteins from PDB were taken and the shortest distance from an
/// orbital to a polar or aromatic hydrogen was recorded and binned. In addition to the shortest distance,
/// an angle was taken. The angle considered is the angle between the base atom that contains the orbital, the
/// orbital, and the hydrogen. For polar hydrogens, only sidechain polar hydrogens were considered.
///
/// For protein interactions, there are 7 classes (orbital types) of orbitals that statistics are generated.
/// These 7 types are mapped using a map to enum data structure. For each sidechain interaction, only the shortest
/// distance between any given orbital type to a hydrogen is calculated. That means, that for each sidechain interaction
/// only 1 distance, 1 angle, and 1 class is recorded.
///
/// Bin sizes were calculated by .1A for distance and cos of 1 for angles. See below:
///
///           angle
///       -1 -.9 -.8 -.7..........
/// d .1 | 0   0   0   0
/// i .2 | 500 0   0   0
/// s .3 | 25  0   0   0
/// t .4 |  0  30  5   0
///
/// This is not the original code that was used to generate the statistics. The original code was much more
/// convoluted than this because I had no idea how to program. I wrote this piece for clarity. I have tested
/// it and it produces the same results.
