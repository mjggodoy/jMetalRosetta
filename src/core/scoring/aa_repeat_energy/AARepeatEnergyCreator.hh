/// @brief Creator for an EnergyMethod that penalizes stretches of a repeating amino acid (e.g. poly-Q sequences).
/// @details This energy method is inherently not pairwise decomposible.  However, it is intended for very rapid calculation,
/// and has been designed to plug into Alex Ford's modifications to the packer that permit it to work with non-pairwise scoring
/// terms.
