The calculators in this directory:
InterfaceDefinitionCalculatorBase.cc
InterfaceDeltaEnergeticsCalculator.cc
InterfaceNeighborDefinitionCalculator.cc
InterfaceSasaDefinitionCalculator.cc
SasaCalculator.cc

were in protocols/toolbox/pose_metric_calculators before XRW2.  They were moved to main because the scripter (protocols/jd2/DockDesignParser) is directly dependent on them.  This is a partial solution.  Good full solutions:

A) move all simple, core-only-dependencies calculators in protocols/toolbox/pose_metric_calculators to this directory
B) Create a string-name-based load-time-factory-registration system for calculator _classes_ (not calculator objects as now) so that the Parser's dependency will be string-based or nonexistent
