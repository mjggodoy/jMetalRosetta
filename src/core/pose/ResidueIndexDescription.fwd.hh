/// @file   src/core/pose/ResidueIndexDescription.fwd.hh
/// @brief  Two classes designed to hold data neceassary to describe a residue in a Pose,
///         which may come from a text file, e.g., and to resolve that data into an actual
///         residue index when a Pose becomes available (which is likely not at the time
///         that the file is read) and to throw an exception if the index cannot be resolved.
