/// @author Robert Lindner (rlindner@mpimf-heidelberg.mpg.de)
/// @author Jared Adolf-Bryfogle (jadolfbr@gmail.com) - 10 A neighbor graph, simplification, ResidueSubset as focus, clean up, etc.
/// @author Gerard Daniel (gerardda@uw.edu) added support for using custom atom names for distance measure as an alternative to using neighbor atom. This should be especially useful when selecting around a ligand.
