///
/// @brief  Information about the membrane bilayer and its relationship with the protein(s)
/// @details MembraneInfo is responsible for describing attributes of the
///    membrane bilayer *and* the position & orientation of the bilayer
///    in 3D space. All of the data members work together to accomplish
///    this representation. And the players are:
///     = A pointer to the Pose Conformation, which includes an MEM residue
///     = The lipid type represented in this membrane (Default: DOPC: (18:1/18:1))
///     = Profiles describing chemical characteristics of the bilayer. Including:
///      = Electrostatics
///      = Hydrogen bonding potential
///      = Polarity
///     = Topology of transmembrane spans
///     = Per-residue lipophilicity
///     = Membrane thickness & steepness - derived from chemical profiles
///
///    This object is a member of Conformation and should be accessed by
///    pose.conofrmation().membrane_info(). DO NOT access the MEM residue
///    outside of the framework!!!
