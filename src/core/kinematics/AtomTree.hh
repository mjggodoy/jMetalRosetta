/// @brief The AtomTree class is a wrapper for a tree of kinematic Atoms.
///
/// @details The responsibilities of the class are:
///
/// @li 1. Maintain a map from AtomIDs to Atoms for fast lookup.
///
/// @li 2. Keep the internal and xyz coords of the Atoms in sync.
///    Note that this sync'ing is handled
///    in a lazy fashion, analogous to the way the current pose handles
///    refolding. As a result, getting and setting of coords can trigger
///    coordinate updates.
///
/// @li 3. Gatekeep modification of internal or xyz coords for the Atoms
///    (necessary for #2).
///
/// @li 4. Serve out the xyz coords for updating a Pose/Conformation object.
///
/// @li 5. Identify DOF_IDs that correspond to torsion angles (e.g., phi, psi, chi, nu)
///    specified by 4 AtomIDs. Do this in a way that enables fast
///    lookup, e.g., caching the results of previous calls (?).
///    Note that some torsions will not correspond exactly to a DOF of
///    an Atom; e.g., chi1 when we are folding c->n, necessitating
///    calculation of an offset. We should be able to handle getting/setting
///    of these torsion angles as well as handing back the DOF_ID
///    (the last one is necessary when setting up the DOF_IDMask for
///    minimization given a MoveMap object).

	/// next time this AtomTree's topology changes, or the next time the src AtomTree's topology
	/// changes, the "observer" connection between the two of them is severed -- each AtomTree
	/// getting modified. This is not a thread-safe operation! If the AtomTree's have matching
